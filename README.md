# My neovim config for working with python and JS
This is the config I currently use for writing python and javascript. I tried to keep it simple, but containing the functionalities I need.
## Key components
* DAP with custom key bindings (the ones I enjoy)
* File formatting for languages I use the most
* Navigation between files
* custom keybidings (I did not manage to keep them all in one place as usual, especially for CMP, but it's easy to ripgrem them all, as most go with vim.keymap*)
* Braces and quote marks closing in insert mode

## Acknowledgments
I'd like to thank all awesome people providing and working on the plugins, and of course the Neovim developers for making this possible. It's great.
